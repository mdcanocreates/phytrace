# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of phytrace:

| Version | Supported          |

| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in phytrace, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security details to: mdcanocreates@gmail.com
   - Include a clear description of the vulnerability
   - Provide steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Include any proof-of-concept code (if safe to share)
3. We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
4. We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
5. We will keep you informed of our progress toward a fix

### What to Report

Please report:
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Data exposure or leakage
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Any issue that could compromise user data or systems

### What NOT to Report

The following are generally not considered security vulnerabilities:
- Issues that require physical access to the system
- Issues that require social engineering
- Issues that require already-compromised user accounts
- Denial of service attacks that require an unreasonable amount of resources
- Issues in dependencies (please report to the upstream project)

### Disclosure Policy

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will coordinate public disclosure after a fix is available
- We aim to provide a fix within 30 days for critical vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

When using phytrace:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update phytrace and its dependencies
2. **Review evidence packs**: Check manifest.json for unexpected environment changes
3. **Validate invariants**: Use invariant checking to catch unexpected behavior
4. **Secure evidence storage**: Evidence packs may contain sensitive data - store securely
5. **Use trusted sources**: Only install phytrace from PyPI or the official repository

## Security Considerations

phytrace is designed for scientific simulations and does not:
- Handle authentication or authorization
- Process untrusted user input directly
- Access network resources by default
- Store sensitive data persistently

However, evidence packs generated by phytrace may contain:
- System information
- Environment details
- Simulation parameters
- Trajectory data

**Always review evidence packs before sharing publicly.**
