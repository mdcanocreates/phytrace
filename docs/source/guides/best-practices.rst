Best Practices
==============

Invariant Selection
-------------------

- Use ``finite()`` for all simulations
- Add ``bounded()`` checks for known limits
- Use custom invariants for physical constraints

Evidence Packs
--------------

- Store evidence packs with your code
- Include in version control (or archive separately)
- Reference evidence packs in publications
